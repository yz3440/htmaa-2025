# HTMAA 2025

This is the repository for my [HTMAA 2025](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863//) blog website. The site it built here with Github Action and then committed to the Center of Bits and Atoms (CBA) GitLab server. And then via a GitLab CI job, the site is deployed to the CBA GitLab server as a static website, [here](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/).

## Site Highlight

The site uses the same custom MDX component library I used to build my personal website, [yufengzhao.com](https://yufengzhao.com/). I think it looks pretty cool.

## Running the website

I personally use [Bun](https://bun.com/) to run the website.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

But you can also use npm to run the website.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
