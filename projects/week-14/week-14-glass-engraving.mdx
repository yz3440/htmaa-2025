## Assignment

- individual assignment:
  - design and produce something with a digital fabrication process not covered in another assignment

This semester's options were: multi-axis machining, microfabrication, NC grinding, wire EDM, waterjet cutting, composites (wet lay-up), robot arms, laser micro machining and CT scanning, metal laser cutting and welding, 2D inflatables (ultrasonic welding), glass engraving (UV laser), limits of laser PCBs, and embroidery.

I chose **glass engraving with UV laser** - using focused UV light to create subsurface markings inside K9 crystal.

## What to Make

I wanted to freeze a fragment of the physical world inside crystal. The idea: capture a [**Google Street View panorama of Washington Square Park (NYC)**](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7310601,-73.9972528,3a,75y,221h,97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seKHNUWxhdsVMzC9kQyaNuQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) and convert it into a spherical point cloud suspended inside a glass cube. (Don't be surprised if that link shows a different view than what's in this documentation - Google sometimes takes down Street Views and redirects to the nearest available one.)

## The Machine

Our lab just got the [xTool F2 Ultra](https://www.xtool.com/products/xtool-f2-ultra-60w-mopa-40w-diode-dual-laser-engraver) with a UV laser module. The UV laser creates tiny micro-fractures at the focal point inside the crystal. These fractures scatter light, creating visible white dots that form 3D images. Pretty cool - the marks are completely internal and protected by the surrounding glass.

## Materials

Our TA Quentin prepared [K9 crystal cubes from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2H822RP) for the session. We used **50mm cubes** because the machine can't easily engrave curved surfaces - the curved glass refracts and scatters the beam.

There's a workaround using [index-matching oil](https://www.atomm.com/project/74963-laser-engraved-solar-system-crystal-globe) that lets you engrave spheres, but xTool doesn't sell it yet (coming January 2026, apparently).

### Classmate's Work before I started

My classmate [Abby](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/AbigailSuk/index.html) 3D scanned her own head and attached some tentacles she found online. Wonderfully creepy.

## Process

### Building pano2points

I built a Python tool called [**pano2points**](https://github.com/yz3440/pano2points) to convert Street View panoramas into engravable point clouds. It uses [streetlevel](https://github.com/sk-zk/streetlevel) to download panoramas directly from Google.

The pipeline: download panorama → filter out bright pixels (sky) → Floyd-Steinberg dithering → map to spherical shell → export as PLY.

The raw image is tilted because it's captured from a camera on a backpack carried by a person walking through the park. When you view it on Street View, Google corrects this in the browser. My tool fetches the pitch/roll metadata and auto-levels the panorama before processing:

The metadata from Google:

```json
{
  "id": "eKHNUWxhdsVMzC9kQyaNuQ",
  "date": "2021-06",
  "lat": 40.73106008840639,
  "lon": -73.9972528394663,
  "pitch": 0.131312750184646,
  "roll": 6.1606266338141396,
  "heading": 3.860726575376108,
  "elevation": 10.22285175323486
}
```

### Generating Point Clouds

```bash
# Download panorama (auto-leveled)
uv run scripts/download_washington_square.py data/washington_square.jpg --zoom 3

# Generate point cloud (brightness filter removes sky)
uv run pano2points data/washington_square.jpg --max-size 8000 -r 25 --brightness-max 0.6
```

The `--brightness-max 0.6` filter removes the sky, keeping buildings, trees, and ground.

| Zoom | Resolution | Points |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| 2    | 2048×1024  | ~158k  |
| 3    | 4096×2048  | ~630k  |
| 4    | 8192×4096  | ~2.4M  |

### Engraving

The xTool software imports the PLY and handles layer-by-layer slicing. The laser starts from the bottom and works up to avoid passing through already-engraved areas.

## Results

I made two versions to compare resolutions:

### Version 1: ~158k points

Only took about 3 minutes to engrave - very fast. I particularly liked the detail of the trees in the point cloud. Since it's high frequency detail, I wanted to push the resolution higher.

/>

### Version 2: ~630k points

This one took 12 minutes - duration scales linearly with point count, which makes sense (4x the points, 4x the time). The PLY file came out to 19.1MB - xTool's glass engraving software only accepts files under 30MB, so we're good but getting close to the limit.

I love how this one turned out. You can actually make out individual trees and the arch. Sorry about the video quality - compressed video really doesn't do it justice. The photo is more representative.
