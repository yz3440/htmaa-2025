## Assignment

- individual assignment:
  - write an application that interfaces a user with an input &/or output device that you made

## Disclosure

This is a retrofitted assignment from [my final project](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/projects/week-15-hypercarousel-v0/). I'm claiming the ESP32S3 Camera algorithm testing web frontend as my individual assignment.

## Sorry

TODO:Write the doc.
