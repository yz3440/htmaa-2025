I want to vinyl cut a QR code on a black background and stick it to my laptop. The fun part is the QR code goes to this exact blog post.

## Preparing the QR code

I already named this blog post "Vinyl Cutting a QR Code", so the slug will be `vinyl-cutting-a-qr-code`. Because the base URL for my entire blog is

```bash
https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao
```

and the full URL for this blog post is

```bash
https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/projects/vinyl-cutting-a-qr-code
```

To generate the QR code, I used [QR Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/). I chose the black background and the white foreground.

The final QR code is 1000x1000 pixels, and looks like this:

## Some extra sauce

My artist friend [WTTDOTM](https://www.instagram.com/wttdotm/?hl=en)(Morry Kolman) is recently setting up a art piece that creates warped QR codes to work as a "sigil" to force people to move a certain way in order to properly scan it. Here's a series of Instagram stories about it.

I want to roughly replicate this effect with vinyl cutting. So I went into Photoshop and created a warped QR code.

Before I go ahead and cut the vinyl, I did some testing to make sure it's really
hard to scan upfront and the user has to move their phone camera to a weird
angle to scan it.

As you can see, it's really hard to scan it upfront, but once I move the camera extremely close to the screen at a tiled angle, the phone recognizes the QR code.

The final warped QR code looks like this:
