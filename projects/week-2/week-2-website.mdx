## Assignment

- make the website for CBA's self-hosted GitLab

## Where we started

Well, all of us in the HTMAA class started with an blank site on the GitLab repo, deployed by a GitLab CI job to pull the repository into a Nginx server.

```yml
# .gitlab-ci.yml

job:
  script:
    - mkdir -p /var/www/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao
    - export GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/
    - git checkout -f main
    - git pull
```

However, this doesn't include a build step, which is required for a static site generator. Because I really don't want to write raw HTML and CSS for this type of blog site, I decided to find a workaround.

## Site Genration on CBA's GitLab

In 2024, I spent a lot of time to make my personal website easier to maintain. I ended up building a MDX component library powered by a Next.js Static Site Generator (SSG). The Content Management System (CMS) is just a simple GitLab repository.

I think it looks pretty sweet, and I'm quite used to writing my custom MDX syntax. The first thing I did was to copy the entire repository and modify it to fit the CBA's GitLab. In order to make it work, I had to modify the CI job to build the website.

```yml
# .gitlab-ci.yml, modified
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  BUN_VERSION: "latest"

build:
  stage: build
  cache:
    paths:
      - ~/.bun/install/cache/
      - node_modules/
      - .next/cache/
  before_script:
    # Install Bun
    - curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    # Add Bun to PATH for current session
    - export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
    # Verify installation
    - bun --version
  script:
    - export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"
    - bun install
    - bun run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - out/
    expire_in: 1 hour
  only:
    - main

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  dependencies:
    - build
  script:
    - mkdir -p /var/www/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao
    - rm -rf /var/www/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/*
    - cp -r out/* /var/www/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/
  only:
    - main
```

I chose to install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) on the CI runner to build my Next.js website. However, the [pipeline job](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/-/pipelines/48261) not only failed but also froze the entire GitLab server for about 30 minutes (thank god I was doing it during midnight). I realized the GitLab server is probably quite slow, so I immediately reverted the CI configuration.

## Separation of Source Code and Output

Thankfully, I'm not the only person who has this problem. My classmate [Sun Chuanqi's](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/SunChuanqi/) decided to separate the source code and the output. Here's a summary of his approach:

    Sun moved his source code to Github, which is faster than CBA's GitLab.

    Using Github Action to build the site and commit the output to the GitLab
    repository.
  </BulletPoint>
</GridSection>

This is his [repository](https://github.com/chuanqisun/htmaa-2025/), and here's the [Github Action](https://github.com/chuanqisun/htmaa-2025/blob/master/.github/workflows/push-to-gitlab.yml). As written in Sun's instruction, in order for the Github Action to work, I had to add the GitLab access token to the Github repository's secrets, and relax the branch protection policy to allow direct push permission on the `main` branch. Here's the screenshots of how to do them:

## Deployed!

Boom! Now when you commit to your Github repository, `npm run build` will be run automatically, and the output folder will be committed to the root of the GitLab repository.

The source code for my website is [here](https://github.com/yz3440/htmaa-2025/), and the output GitLab repository is [here](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/), and the website is [here](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/).
