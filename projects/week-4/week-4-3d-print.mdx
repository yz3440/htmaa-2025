## Assignment

- design, document, and 3D print an object that could not be made subtractively (small, few cm3, limited by printer time)

## Previous progress

As I mentioned in my [previous post](../laser-cutting-an-icosahedron-kit/), I've been using 3D printing to manufacture the joints (with the help of [Icosahedron Printed Joints Generator](https://www.instructables.com/Icosahedron-Printed-Joints-Generator/) and [Shuang Cai](https://shuangcai.cargo.site/)), and used off-the-shelf acrylic rods (diameter 1/8 inch, or 3.175mm) for the beams.

The problem is that we didn't figure out a way to gracefully mount triangle sheets of film on top of the icosahedron faces. In the prototype, we just taped the film to the it as a temporary solution.

## The Plan

I want the triangle to slide into potentially some slit on the beam to stay in place. The width of the slit needs to be very very thin, paper thin. Another thing I want to keep about the previous prototype is that we try to make each part as transparent as possible: the joint connectors are printed with PETG Clear filament, and the beams are just clear acrylic rods. SLA resin printing just felt like a perfect thing to try to get both fine details and transparency.

## Modeling in Fusion 360

Along the process, I made so many iterations of the design, a few are because of the difference precision and tolerance of the different printing materials and processes. I'm glad that I started off with everything parametrically so that I have a lot of flexibility to tweak the design later on.

### Rod Design

Here's the parameters for the rod model.

| Parameter         | Value      | Note           |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| rod_face_diameter | 3.175 mm   |
| dihedral_angle    | 138.19 deg |
| slit_angle        | 12 deg     | Not being used |

| slit_width        | 0.8 mm     |
| slit_length       | 1.2 mm     |

### Printing rods

I'm using Formlab Form 4 with Clear V5 material. I asked Dan to give me a walkthrough of the printing process and [Ceci](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/CeciliaMarsicovetereFanjul/) helped me a lot with her fabrication knowledge. Here are the steps I followed:

- Check the build platform
- Print with patience
- Wash with IPA in Bath #1 with plate
- Separate the prints from the plate, blow the plate dry and put it back
- Wash the prints with IPA in Bath #2
- Remove the support from the prints
- Cure the prints with UV light

I started printing the first batch of rods, along with some connectors (modeled by Shuang Cai in June 2025). Shuang sent me an STL file, and the exact dimensions is not captured in the file. I had to manually set the scale to be roughly correct (0.118x scale of the original STL).

The connectors ended up too big for the rods to fit into. At this point, I felt the necessity to remodel the connectors.
