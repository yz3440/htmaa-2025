HyperCarousel is a addon for the Kodak Carousel projectors and a novel slide mount design to add hypertext non-linear navigation capabilities to the slide projector.

## Roadmap

As I mentioned in the [roadmap](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/projects/week-9-hypercarousel-roadmap/), I'm planning to build a working but still MVP version of HyperCarousel.
