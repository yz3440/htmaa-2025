HyperCarousel is a addon for the Kodak Carousel projectors and a novel slide mount design to add hypertext non-linear navigation capabilities to the slide projector.

## Roadmap

As I mentioned in the [roadmap](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/projects/week-9-hypercarousel-roadmap/), I'm planning to build a working but still MVP version of HyperCarousel.

## HyperSlide Design

HyperSlide is a custom slide mount design that enables hypertext navigation in the Kodak Carousel. Each slide mount contains a lookup table that maps hyperlink numbers to destination slide numbers — essentially metadata attached to each slide.

### V0: Testing the Waters

I started by buying [Matin 35mm Slide Mounts 100 Pieces - Glassless White](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008QT9AV2) to understand the physical constraints of slide mounts. I checked some references on slide film dimensions. According to ["How to Tell Which Type of Slides You Have"](https://kodakdigitizing.com/blogs/news/how-to-tell-which-type-of-slides-you-have) by Dillon Wallace, the 35mm film imaging size is 36mm × 24mm, but the entire film for one shot including the sprocket holes is 36mm × 35mm.

</GridSection>

For the transparency film, I bought [Caydo 8.5 x 11 Inch A4 Transparent Film for Screen Printing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFY8FWTX) (I got the A3 11×17 inch version, but they no longer sell that variant).

I'm most comfortable designing in Figma, but designing for print isn't a native feature. My workaround is to assign each pixel a real physical unit — in this design I'm using 1px as 1mm. So I have a 2794×4318 canvas and each film block is 360 × 350 (36mm × 35mm). When I export, I use 4× resolution to keep the text sharp, and when I print, I set the paper to 11×17 and scale to cover 100%.

The content of these slides is mostly sourced from Wikipedia. Text that's underlined indicates hyperlinks connecting to other slides.

Here's a slide about Center for Bits and Atoms mounted in a Matin mount, and a slide about Neil Gershenfeld projected through the Kodak Carousel 600:

In the original roadmap, I wanted to use a mouse/trackball interaction to control a cursor on the projector. So I did some testing — I drew a cursor on an empty piece of slide and put both the Neil slide and cursor slide into the projector. Turns out (obviously) the projector couldn't focus on both slides at the same time on the projection plane. This led to my following design that gives up on the cursor idea and settles on the numpad & lookup table compromise.

### V1: The Punchcard Inspiration

I was originally thinking I'd want to use a punchcard. This is because I want everything as analog as possible, and the IBM Punchcard was a well-established standard. I even found a variation with a slide embedded in a punchcard (taking up 1/3 of punch space, using the same size as IBM punchcard). These are called aperture cards, used for archiving image documents like blueprints efficiently with the help of sorting and indexing provided by the punch. Basically metadata-attached microfilms — something similar to what I want to achieve here.

</GridSection>

But then I'd need to use optical sensors to read it. I wasn't ready to die on this hill. I compromised by allowing myself to use a camera system via ESP32, so I designed a human-readable table with some marks for camera registration. A person can just write the lookup table (which link goes to which slide, or a hyperlink index → slide number mapping) on the slide mount.

So this is my design: 5 mounts laid out on a letter-sized canvas. I made the width the same as the slide mount requirement (2 inch / 51.3mm) and doubled the height to 4 inch (102.6mm). I located the 36×24mm film cutout at the right location and put a two-column table on top (one says `link #`, the other says `to #`).

  caption="V1 design layout — 5 HyperSlide mounts on letter-sized cardstock"

I used [White Cardstock 8.5 x 11, 230gsm Cover Cardstock Paper, 85 Lb Heavy Card](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJX2153R) for the material.

I put my design in the xTool P2 laser cutter. I wanted to engrave the table and cut the mount contour and film slot. I realized the text part is recognized as engrave, and all the rest are score. I needed to manually assign the text to engrave, the table frame lines to score, and the outer lines to cut.

Also, my SVG did not preserve dimensions well. I had to manually rescale the shapes so that the width of each one is 50mm.

I taped my film and the slide mount together:

</GridSection>

I tested the film in my projector... and it got stuck halfway. I think it might be too wide? I used my caliper to measure the Matin slide mount, and it reads 50.15mm — same as what I had. But paper flexes more than plastic. So I decided to trim my cardstock on both sides with scissors and test again. It worked! The slide goes up and down in the projector smoothly.

### V2: Getting the Width Right

I changed the width from 50mm to 48mm and everything works now. I used the same laser settings and made ten of them on two pieces of letter-sized cardstock. And I used glue stick this time to mount the film — a lot cleaner!

### V3: Seven-Segment Marking Attempt

Later in the project I was having trouble with digit recognition, so I decided to change the design to include some marking to help users write seven-segment digits at designated locations.

  src="/project-assets/final-project/hypercarousel/0-hyper-slide/v3-0-film-mounts.jpeg"
  caption="V3 design with seven-segment digit guides scored on the mount"
/>

I did not end up using these because the scoring marks are too dark even at 200mm/s and 1% power setting, which creates high contrast and messes with my CV algorithm even more. I'll talk about this in detail in the lookup-table recognition section below.

## Aluminum Frame

I started out wanting to prototype with 2020 aluminum extrusions — they're easy to work with and let you iterate on mounting configurations quickly. I arranged four pieces in a square: the front and back rails sit at the bottom, while the left and right rails are raised higher. This creates a cradle that locks the projector in place from all sides.

Turns out the Kodak Carousel 600 fits _perfectly_ in a 276×276mm square. Like, suspiciously perfectly. You can even lift the whole assembly up by the frame without worrying about the projector falling out — the fit is that snug. What started as a quick test jig ended up being good enough for the final presentation, so I just kept it.

## Button Pressor Servo

The Kodak Carousel has physical buttons for advancing slides forward and backward. Rather than hacking into the electronics, I decided to just... press the buttons with a servo. Sometimes the dumbest solution is the best solution.

The servo I'm using is an [ANNIMOS 20KG Digital Servo](https://www.amazon.com/ANNIMOS-Digital-Waterproof-DS3218MG-Control/dp/B076CNKQX4) — high torque, full metal gear, waterproof (overkill for button pressing, but I had it lying around). It should be more than enough to press the button.

### V0: Initial Design

I planned to mount the servo on the aluminum extrusion near the film advancement button. First step: measure the servo. The body (not including the mounting wings) is 39.67mm × 19.88mm. The mounting screws are M3, so I'm using 3.4mm holes.

  src="/project-assets/final-project/hypercarousel/2-button-pressor-servo/v0-0-measuring-servo.jpeg"
  caption="Measuring the servo body — 39.67mm × 19.88mm"
/>

I modeled everything parametrically in Fusion 360 using 40 × 20mm as the nominal dimensions. The bottom is shaped to sit on top of the extrusion while leaving clearance for the projector body (which sticks out a bit on the sides).

I forgot to add a notch for the cable coming out from the motor. Back to Fusion 360...

### V1: Cable Notch

Added the notch for the cable, plus some curves on the edges hoping it would make them thicker for better structural integrity.

It works great, but I think it would look nicer if the model had recesses where the M3 nuts go.

### V2: Nut Recesses

Added hexagonal pockets for the nuts to sit flush. All the dimensions are parameterized in the Fusion 360 file so they're easy to tweak.

The previous prints were black PLA. For the final version, I switched to [OVERTURE Rock PLA Marble filament](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F4RCJ659) — it has mixed particles that give a white pebble stone texture. Bonus: it hides layer lines really well.

### Software Test

Before integrating with the main board, I wrote a standalone test program to verify the servo works. It runs on an ESP32 (XIAO ESP32-S3) and serves a web interface for controlling the servo — useful for finding the right angles without recompiling. I tested this on the MLDEV WiFi network at Media Lab.

The code sets up a simple web server with two main features: a slider for direct angle control, and a sequence player that can run through a list of angles with configurable delays between each step. The sequence format is just `angle,delay_ms` per line, which made it easy to test different button-pressing motions.

Key configuration — the servo rests at 120° and swings down to 0° to press the button:

```cpp
// Servo positions and speed
#define RESTING_POSITION 120    // Resting position (degrees)
#define ACTIVATION_POSITION 0   // Activation position (degrees)
#define SERVO_SPEED_MS 800      // Time to move from 0 to 120 degrees (ms)
#define SERVO_MS_PER_DEGREE (SERVO_SPEED_MS / 120.0)  // ~6.67ms per degree
```

The sequence execution runs in the main loop, checking if enough time has passed before moving to the next step:

```cpp
// Handle sequence execution
if (sequenceRunning && stepCount > 0) {
  unsigned long now = millis();
  if (now - lastSequenceTime >= steps[sequenceIndex].delayMs) {
    sequenceIndex++;
    if (sequenceIndex >= stepCount) {
      // Sequence complete
      sequenceRunning = false;
      sequenceIndex = 0;
    } else {
      // Execute next step
      myServo.write(steps[sequenceIndex].angle);
      currentAngle = steps[sequenceIndex].angle;
      lastSequenceTime = now;
    }
  }
}
```

(You'll notice some weird text in the web interface — the frontend was vibe-coded with emoji, but the ESP32 doesn't render them properly. It still works though!)
