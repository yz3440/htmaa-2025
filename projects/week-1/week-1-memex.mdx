## Assignment

- model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project,
- compress your images and videos,
- and post a description with your design files on your class page

## My past experience

In the past, I've worked with laser cutting and 3d printing for a fair bit. In fact, I was even supervising the [Fabrication Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/nyushanghai-fabrication-lab/) at NYU Shanghai during my fellowship in [Interactive Media Arts](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/content/interactive-media-arts).

However, I wouldn't say I'm an expert in either of these technologies. I avoided using a proper CAD software and tried to get away as much as possible with Adobe Illustrator, TinkerCad, and straight up 3d scanning.

Well, my limited skills didn't stop me from coming up with bigger ideas, some of which I later found out requires fabrication skills above and beyond the level I would like to learn in a short time. Below is one of them.

## Film projection setup

When I first read Vannevar Bush's [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/), I found myself already 21-year-old and felt quite uneducated. It turns out the concept of hypertext was invented in 1945, just imagined differently with different technologies: a sophisticated microfilm projection setup.

Of course, now we have digital hypertext all around us on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), but I like the physicality of the original proposal, especially low-tech solutions are having a comeback in the post-pandemic era. In 2020, I learned about [DIY Perks's DIY projector project in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfvTjQ9MCwY). Learning all my optics knowledge from Youtube, I think I could build one my version of Memex, starting with a film projection setup.

At the time I was living in Shanghai, so the activation cost for kicking off the project was quite low. I sourced all the parts cheaply from Taobao.

| Item                                        | Cost             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Foggy projector lens                        | $10              |
| 200W COB LED light                          | $30              |
| 300W power supply                           | $10              |
| Two 300mm acrylic Fresnel lenses            | $10 each         |
| Clamps and light stands                     | $40              |
| Pack of transparent film for laser printing | $8               |
| Laser printing                              | Free (at school) |

Sadly, this is basically how far I got: an affordable prove-of-concept film projection setup. In order to implement hypertext-like behavior, there are two major challenges.

So far there is no electronic component in the setup, which is part of the goal: to make the project as low-tech as possible. If I can do it purely with mechanical components, I wouldn't go electrical. If I have to go electrical, I wouldn't go electronic.
