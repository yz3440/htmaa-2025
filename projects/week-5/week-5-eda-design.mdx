## Assignment

- group assignment
  - use the test equipment in your lab to observe the operation of an embedded microcontroller
- individual assignment
  - use an EDA tool to design an embedded microcontroller system using parts from the inventory, check its design rules for fabrication, and simulate its operation
  - extra credit
    - try another design workflow
    - design a case

## Something useful for the final project

[As previously mentioned in my first week's post](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.25/people/YufengZhao/projects/final-project-ideation/#for-scrolling-browsing-mechanics), I'm planning to make a version of Memex by reimagining the modern web browser experience with low tech. One of the key components is the scrolling mechanism, which I'm imagining to use a trackball device to control the scrolling. After some googling on the optical sensor for the trackball (I've thought about purely mechanical solutions like a wheel or a ball, but this part of the class is about electronics so here we are), I found the PixArt PMW3360 sensor.

## PixArt PMW3360

PixArt PMW3360 is an optical mouse sensor found in many mice and trackballs. Here's the [datasheet for the PixArt PMW3360 sensor](https://d3s5r33r268y59.cloudfront.net/datasheets/9604/2017-05-07-18-19-11/PMS0058-PMW3360DM-T2QU-DS-R1.50-26092016._20161202173741.pdf). On page 8, it seems that the sensor comes with a chip and a lens, but the customer will have to supply their own breakout PCB and base plate for the lens.

There are a few vendors that sell the sensor with their own breakout PCB, for example [Joe's Sensors and Sundry](https://lectronz.com/stores/citizenjoe) on [LECTRONZ.com](https://lectronz.com/products/pmw3360-motion-sensor). Although I'll probably opt for a bare sensor from [AliExperess](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806021867041.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt), in the spirite of the class, I do appreciate their [open source effort](https://github.com/mrjohnk/PMW3360DM-T2QU) in designing the breakout PCB. I also stumbled upon a few other open source PCD designs, such as [this one by kbjunky](https://github.com/kbjunky/PMW3360), and this one by [jfedor2](https://github.com/jfedor2/rp2040-pmw3360) (specifically for the RP2040).

These open source designs saved me a lot of time reading the datasheet and understanding the sensor.

I also found a symbol and footprint for the sensor on [SnapMagic](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/PMW3360DM-T2QU/PixArt/view-part/) created by trimenz. After eyeballing the footprint against the datasheet, I think I can use it.
